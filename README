GAMEd, a daemon for setting high priority

GAMEd is a little daemon, designed to allow to give high
priority to several programs at once. This is needed because
only ROOT can do it, so a daemon is needed to allow all users
to change, in a safe way, the priority to some programs.

The main utility is for OpenGL (3D) games. Under Linux,
some window managers can reduce the performance of the games,
unless high priority is given to both X server and window
manager itself. This is the objective of GAMEd: to allow to
automagically set the high priority each time you enter your
session.

INSTALL GAMEd

Just type

	make
	sudo make install

and it will be installed. Now, just set the desired priority
(-20 is the maximum priority for a program) with the command

	renice_gamed PRIORITY

GAMEd will remember this value (-20 is the default, if you
don't write a value), and will set it every time you enter
your session.

If you experience problems due to the high priority, you
can set it again to 0 when you want with

	renice_gamed 0

and activate it only when you want to play. Take into account
that, sometimes, it will need some minutes to take fully
effect, due to the way Linux manages the priorities.

To uninstall it, just type:

	sudo make uninstall
